			<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
			<p>CO has officially opened its flagship store and brand headquarters at 622 N. Western Avenue in Los Angeles.</p>
			<hr>
			<h5>CO is a Los Angeles-based womenswear brand founded in 2011 by Stephanie Danan and Justin Kern. The name CO reflects the designers’ collaborative partnership, as well as their philosophy behind building a cohesive, complimentary wardrobe.<br><br> The brand’s Essentials—a seasonless collection available year-round—reflects a foundational approach to dressing, while the ready-to-wear explores the ever-evolving definition of “classic”.Located next door to the sprawling new Zwirner Gallery, CO’s first ever retail store will sit at the center of a burgeoning new creative hub that will soon include a half dozen art galleries, restaurants, and other creative businesses. This project would not have been possible without the vision and collaboration of Zach Lasry and Creative Space, and the hard work of the entire CO team.<br><br>

Los Angeles, CA 90004<br>
